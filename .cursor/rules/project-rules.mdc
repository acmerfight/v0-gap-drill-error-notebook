# Project Development Standards

**⚠️ Please read and strictly follow all rules and principles in `CLAUDE.md` documentation.**

## Core Requirements

### 📚 Documentation First
- Any changes to project architecture, technology stack, or engineering practices must immediately update `CLAUDE.md` and this document
- Documentation inconsistencies lead to reduced development efficiency and poor decision-making

### 🛠️ Tech Stack Compliance
Strictly follow the tech stack defined in `CLAUDE.md`:
- Runtime: Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript 5
- Database: Neon PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- Validation: Zod
- UI: Tailwind CSS 4 + Radix UI (shadcn/ui)
- Linting: ESLint 9 + TypeScript ESLint + Prettier
- Git Hooks: Husky + lint-staged

### 🔒 Code Quality
- 🚫 No `git commit --no-verify`
- 📏 TypeScript strict mode for type safety
- 🔍 Enforce ESLint security rules
- 🪝 All commits must pass Husky + lint-staged checks

### 🚫 Git Workflow
- Strictly no direct push to main branch
- All code must be submitted via Pull Request
- No exceptions (including administrators)

### 🐙 GitHub CLI Workflow
Use GitHub CLI (`gh`) for all GitHub operations:
- `gh pr create` - Create a Pull Request
- `gh pr view` - View PR details and status
- `gh pr checks` - Check PR CI/CD status
- `gh pr merge` - Merge Pull Request (after all checks pass)

**Important**: Always verify all checks pass before merging (`gh pr checks`)

### 🧠 Core Principles (The Rule)
- Errors should never pass silently
- Types over runtime assumptions
- Composition over inheritance
- Explicit over implicit magic
- In the face of ambiguity, refuse to guess
- There should be one obvious way to do it
- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea

## Development Commands

Use pnpm to run project commands:
- `pnpm dev` - Development mode
- `pnpm build` - Build project
- `pnpm ci` - Complete CI pipeline (must pass before commit)
- `pnpm lint:fix` - Auto-fix code formatting
- `pnpm type-check` - TypeScript type checking

See `CLAUDE.md` for complete command list.
